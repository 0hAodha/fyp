"2025/04/05 10:19:36 am CET","Middling","When I had a lot of bus and train data loaded, the performance could be quite slow.","Very unintuitive","Easy","The help tab was there, I would say the button might be better if it was a one time pop up suggestion of where to access it ","Better","It feels less clunky and more transparent in what it provides.","Probably","If the application was a mobile friendly app, I would certainly use it. Especially if it had bus delays","Definitely","It gives me a lot of context on where my train or bus actually is, and I am not relying on information boards that can be inaccurate.","I can view everything I want, when I want. Particularly you can can set it to view only a certain local area, as to not load irrelevant data.","Half of my Luas l√≠ne being missing","The bus lines being drawn for a route"

Will certainly use this application if so.","Definitely","Really good application, easy to use and gives data on all the forms of transport so I would not have to use multiple trackers if I was using more than one form of transport that day.","It was very easy to use and had tracking for the various forms of transport in one place.","Couldn't really say. It seemed to have all the features that I personally would need.","No"
"2025/04/05 10:51:53 pm CET","Very easy","This service was easy and intuitive to use, similar in a way to ""powercheck.ie"" although I did find this service superior in the animations  and clustering of icons, as well as the handy colour coding.","Intuitive","Very easy","The website was clearly laid out, and the Help/FAQ section providided me with all necessary information.","Better","As stated in my answer to previous questions, I found the User Interface to be much smoother and seamless than other applications I have previously encountered.","Probably","As I am an infrequent traveller on such services, it is not a product i would use often. However, in a situation in which I would be using services such as Bus Eireann, this product would be essential.","Definitely","As stated before. Although I dont travel often using trains/busses, when I inevitably will be, I believe that this product would be extremely handy.","I liked the UI, I found the icons for trains/ busses and stations to all be easily distinguishable, and the application ran quite smoothly. During my time using it I encountered no bugs whatsoever.","I found very little if anything wrong with the application. Although, I believe an introduction of Northern Irish transport services could be useful, due to the slight overlap of routes.","No. I my closest experience to an app of this nature would be powercheck.ie, and I found this service to be better with regard to features."

Most information is available at point of use, with some further info on the FAQ page.","Better","The integration of multiple transport services makes for a better overall user-centric experience.","Definitely","","Definitely","","It was very fast, despite the potentially large amount of data to be fetched and processed.","Would like satellite tiles option.","I thought there could be an icon for parking etc.at luas stops."
