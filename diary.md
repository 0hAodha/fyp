### Meeting with Supervisor
- Discussed research ethics, supervisor sent the following documents from the research ethics committee:
  - Plain language statement.
  - Consent form.
- Discussed project definition document:
  - Decided on LaTeX document.
  - Decided to work on initial draft and then get review from supervisor.
- Discussed final report:
  - Decided on LaTeX document.
  - Decided to start working on immediately, adding to it as progress is made.
  - Focus on including non-trivial progress in report immediately rather than diary.
- Discussed diary:
  - Although had set up Confluence for this meeting, decided to use a plain Markdown file to simplify the diary, keep all materials in the one Git repository, and focus on including non-trivial progress in the final report rather than the diary.
- Discussed competitor analysis:
  - Table with rows for each "competitor" product and columns for questions about how they do things.
  - Decided to include this directly in final report when table created rather than put in diary.
- Decided to focus on primarily developing product as a web app, with a secondary requirement to port it to mobile if possible.
- Discussed React vs React Native:
  - React Native is more effort and more difficult to develop in: reduced compatibility with vanilla React.
  - Discussed if worth using React Native if focussing on web.
  - For time being, decided to focus on React Native development *for web* while maintaining maximum mobile portability. Not focusing on mobile development but trying not to break anything, and attempting to port at the end of development.
  - TODO: By end of week, make permanent decision on framework & target platform.
  - Since React was originally chosen specifically for React Native, worth considering not using React if only focussing on web development. Other options:
    - Apache Cordova for porting to mobile.
    - Pure HTML & JavaScript for web app.
    - Other frameworks, e.g. Vue.
- Discussed map & plotting libraries:
  - Leading choice is Mapbox: works with React Native, free up to 50,000 monthly map loads.
- Action items:
  - [ ] Create final report LaTeX document.
  - [ ] Add skeleton of PDD to Git repository.
  - [ ] Make decision on React vs React Native.
